///   @override
///   String get name => "FreeBuds 4i";
/// }

  /// - Huawei - not HUAWEI nor huawei
  /// - Xiaomi - not redmi or some other bs
  /// - Samsung
  /// - etc

  /// Don't worry, we will not be basing any name-matching on that or anything,
  /// this is somewhat for debugging purposes etc

  /// like on the market as possible (sometimes it's FREEBUDS, sometimes
  /// Freebuds - but most often FreeBuds - stick to that üëç)
