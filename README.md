# FreeBuddy

Free and open source app for Huawei Freebuds 4i headphones 🎧

## Why?

I wanted to quickly switch ANC modes on my headphones...

but official app is... well, bloated as hell 😑 - it weights 100mb, and takes (on my phone) 10 seconds to open...

Also, it doesn't have features like "find lost headphones", etc...

So I got mad and decided to make my own... and here it is 🌈
